# Metropolis-Hastings with Scalable Subsampling
Python scripts that can be used to reproduce the figures and tables presented in the paper "Metropolis-Hastings with Scalable Subsampling" (arxiv, 2024).

Some datasets used in the real-world applications can be found in the UCI machine learning repository, and the links are provided in the scripts. The road casualties dataset can be downloaded from the R package "stats19" as shown in the corresponding script. Finally, the US census dataset of the is provided in this repository.
